# Amazon Clone

**Amazon Clone** is a front-end project that replicates the Amazon homepage using HTML and CSS. It features:

- Navigation bar
- Hero section
- Category panel
- Footer

This project highlights my skills in creating clean, user-friendly interfaces, marking a key step in my web development journey.
